# Meow Hash Node

## Overview

NodeJS bindings for Casey Muratori's Meow Hash - https://github.com/cmuratori/meow_hash/

Meow is a 128-bit Level 3 hash taking 128 bytes of seed. It operates at very high speeds on x64 processors, and potentially other processors that provide accelerated AES instructions.

## Installation

With NPM: `npm install https://github.com/FenrirWillow/meow-hash-node`

With yarn: `yarn add https://github.com/FenrirWillow/meow-hash-node`

When the module is installed, it will try to rebuild itself. Make sure you have a compiler toolchain setup for your target.
